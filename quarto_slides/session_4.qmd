::: notes
Here's our plan for the course. We can adapt as we go and I learn more about pacing. Today I hope to talk about Data Visualization
:::

## Goals for Today {.smaller}

**Transforming data with `dplyr`**

-   Using `select` to get just certain columns
-   Using `filter` to get just certain rows
-   Using `mutate` to create new columns
-   Creating pipelines of these transformations

And some bonus color stuff to add on from last week!

::: notes
Data visualization is useful because it helps you understand your data for your own exploration, and because it's generally how we communicate our research findings in an information-dense way. But first, we ended really suddenly last time and I want to make sure we go over the exercise file from last time.
:::

## Update Your Exercise Files {.smaller}

-   Open your "R 101 Exercises" project:
    -   click on the .Rproj file in that folder OR
    -   In RStudio, go to File \> Open Project in New Session
-   Update your project with my latest additions:
    -   click the "Git" button at the top
    -   choose "Pull Branches"

## The Data Analysis Pipeline

In this section, we'll build skills that deal with tidying and transforming data by reshaping data to meet your needs.

a grammar for transforming data frames

`library(dplyr)` OR `library(tidyverse)`
:::
:::

::: notes
`dplyr` (pronounced dee-ply-er, a play on words with "data" and "pliers") is a useful R package we'll discuss in this section. The various functions we'll use, like `select`, `filter`, and `mutate` are all functions that belong to the `dplyr` package.

Just as a reminder, in R, we bring in the functionality of a package by using the `library()` command. Because `dplyr` forms part of the `tidyverse` suite of packages, we can bring in the useful functions of `dplyr` by either using the `library(dplyr)` command or the `library(tidyverse)` command.

The idea behind dplyr is that any data analytic task can be broken down into a small number of basic or atomic tasks, and there should be a consistent way to specify each atomic task - a grammar.

As we will see in this last section, each dplyr function takes a data frame, does something with it, and then returns a modified data frame as its output. Dplyr functions can be strung together to create powerful data analysis pipelines in just a few lines of code.
:::

## Subsetting Data {.section-break background-image="media/cork-board.png" background-size="400px" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: notes
Often, you have a large data frame but want to create a graph or analyze data from only a small part of it. The `dplyr` package, part of the larger [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages, works great for this purpose.

Let's look at how you can subset a data frame (choose only certain columns and/or rows) by using `dplyr`.
:::

## Subsetting Columns vs Rows

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`select()`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](media/dplyr_select.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`filter()`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](media/dplyr_filter.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::: notes
`dplyr` provides two functions for subsetting data frames: `select()` for subsetting columns, and `filter()` for subsetting rows:

`select()` reshapes data so that it includes only the columns you specify.

`filter()` reshapes data so that it includes only the rows that meet your conditions.
:::

## select()

Choose some columns to preserve in a selection.

`select(data_frame, [column or columns])`

::: notes
Let's look at `select()` first. The `select()` function extracts **columns** from a data frame, using the columns as argument(s).

`select()` takes a data frame as its first argument. After that it takes any number of additional arguments that specify the names of the columns that you want to pick.

We extract columns by name with code that looks like this, and we replace the three dots with the names of the columns we want to keep.
:::

::: notes

So we're going to start with a data frame.  You can see here that I haven't put in all the rows and columns, the ellipses here represent columns I haven't included, and I've only put in the first five rows.  But hopefully this is recognizably the cirrhosis dataset.

Let's say I want a version of this data that only preserves a few columns of this dataset.

:::

## select() {.tiny-text}

**Before**

|ID|N_Days|Status|Drug|Age|Sex|...|Tryglicerides|Platelets|Prothrombin|Stage|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|400|D|D-penicillamine|21464|F|...|172|190|12.2|4|

|4|1925|D|D-penicillamine|19994|F|...|92|183|10.3|4|
|5|1504|CL|Placebo|13918|F|...|72|136|10.9|3|

**Using the `select` function**

`select(cirrhosis, ID, N_Days, Status, Drug)`


::: notes
Let's examine the code on this slide.

This `select` statement will take the data frame `cirrhosis`, and return a new data frame that only has the columns I indicate.

An important point to note here is that `select` **will not modify the original data frame** but simply returns the altered data frame you asked for.  It will simply print out the result in the console or in your R Markdown document. If you want to **capture** the modified data frame you need to **assign** it to a named object using the arrow operator.

In my case, I'm telling the select function to only hang on to four columns in the cirrhosis data frame, and I mention them by name.  Note that I don't have to put quotes around these column names, because they refer to objects, in this case, whole columns that the select statement already knows about.

## Your Turn {.smaller background-color="#e3faf1"}

Which of the following will select the `Ascites` column from the `cirrhosis` data frame and capture the result in a data frame named `newdata`?

**A)** `newdata = select(Ascites, cirrhosis)`

**B)** `newdata <- select(cirrhosis, Ascites)`

**C)** `select(newdata, cirrhosis, Ascites)`

**D)** `newdata <- select(cirrhosis, ascites)`

**E)** Both B and D


```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes=1)
```

::: notes
Great, we have some folks saying [whatever], others are suggesting [whatever]. The answer is B.

A isn't correct, because the arguments are in the wrong order. The first argument in the tidyverse functions we're studying today is always going to be the data frame you want to work with. That means the first argument should be cirrhosis.

C isn't correct because you have to use the assignment arrow to save the new, one-column-only data frame to an object called newdata. You don't pass the name you want to apply to the object as an argument.

D isn't right because capitalization matters! 

So E is also clearly incorrect.
:::

## filter()

Choose some conditions to filter the rows you want to keep.

`filter(data_frame, [some condition or conditions for rows])`

::: notes
One of the most important `dplyr` functions to know about is `filter()`. `filter()` extracts rows, and it does that based on **logical criteria**, or a **condition** that can be evaluated to be true (keep that row as part of our subset) or false (don't keep that row).

Like `select()`, `filter()` takes a data frame as its first argument. The second argument is a condition or logical test. R then performs that logical test on each row of the dataset and returns all rows in which the logical test was true.

To extract rows that meet logical criteria, we write code that looks like this, and we'll replace the three dots with one or more logical conditions that the row has to meet.

::: notes
Let's take a look at an example.  Here I have that same shortened version of our cirrhosis data frame, and I want only to look at the subjects who unfortunately died during the course of the study.  I'll filter by their Status, and I want their status to be equal to the letter D.

**Using the `filter` function**

`filter(cirrhosis, Status == "D")`


::: notes

Notice that I put the letter D in quotes, because it's possible that I have a variable or a data frame in my environment.  For example, maybe D is set equal to the name "David", or something like that. But that's not what I want.  I'm not referring to some object called D that R should be looking for, I mean the literal letter D.  So I put it in quotes.

Notice that we're using a double equals here. That's very important!

:::

::: notes
One common issue to be aware of is the difference between the single equals and the double equals operators.

In R, using a single equals sign assigns a value. It demands, "make these things equal."

The double equals sign does not assign, but compares. It asks "**are** these things equal?".

That's why we use double equals in the context of a logical test that compares two values.  

If you use the wrong kind of equals, you'll get an error. This is a very common mistake, and one you're almost guaranteed to accidentally commit at one point or another! This is what some of those scary errors look like!

## Logical Operators {.smaller}

| logical expression | means                    | example                   |
|:------------------:|--------------------------|---------------------------|
|      `x < y`       | less than                | `Cholesterol < 200`.      |
|      `x > y`       | greater than             | `N_Days > 3000`           |
|      `x == y`      | equal to                 | `Ascites == Edema`        |
|      `x <= y`      | less than or equal to    | `Bilirubin <= 2.0`        |
|      `x >= y`      | greater than or equal to | `Copper >= 100`           |
|      `x != y`      | not equal to             | `Status != "D"`.          |
|     `is.na(x)`     | a missing value          | `is.na(Platelets)`        |
|    `!is.na(x)`     | not a missing value      | `!is.na(SGOT)`            |

::: notes
Here are some important logical operators to know about. They will all come in handy when you're filtering rows of a data frame. `x` and `y` each represent expressions, which could be column names or constant values or a combination thereof.

We've already seen the double equals. There are also the less than or and greater than operators. These operators also come as "or equal to" versions.

Use exclamation point equals (some people say "bang equals") if you want to select rows in which a value is **not** equal to another value.

`is.na()` is how you can test for missing values (`NA` in R). This comes in handy when you want to remove missing values from your data, which we'll see later.
:::

## Your Turn {.smaller background-color="#e3faf1"}

Which of these would successfully filter the `cirrhosis` data frame to only subjects who received the placebo?

**A)** `filter(cirrhosis, Drug == Placebo)`

**B)** `filter(cirrhosis, Drug = "Placebo")`

**C)** `filter(cirrhosis, Drug == "Placebo")`

**D)** `filter(cirrhosis, drug == "Placebo")`

```{r echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 1)
```

::: notes
Here we have another multiple choice to see if you're on your toes. Only one of these is correct? Which one? Post what you think in chat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A is wrong because "Placebo" is a character string (it's not a named object or a number, it's a string that needs to be quoted). B is wrong because you're trying to do a comparison with a single equals. C is correct! D is wrong because of capitalization.
:::

## The Pipe Operator %\>% Or |> {.section-break background-image="media/cork-board.png" background-size="400px" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: notes

Let's talk about the pipe operator, which we can use to build pipelines!

:::

## The Pipe Operator %\>% or |>

The pipe operator is `%>%` (from the `magrittr` package, part of the `tidyverse`), or  `|>` (part of base R starting with version 4.1.0).

::: notes
One of the most powerful concepts in the `tidyverse` suite of packages is the pipe operator, which is written in two possible ways:

-   percent, greater than, percent (`%>%`) (this is the original pipe which gets included as part of `dplyr` and `tidyverse`)
-   vertical pipe, greater than (`|>`) (this is a newer option, and is now "native", meaning it comes from base R, if you're using R version 4.1.0 or later)
:::

## The Pipe Operator {.smaller}

![](media/pipe_mini.png){.half fig-align="center"}

::: small-text
Passes the **object on the left** as the **first argument** to the **function on the right**

`cirrhosis %>% filter(Bilirubin <= 3)` is equivalent to `filter(cirrhosis, Bilirubin <= 3)`

OR, if you use the newer pipe:

`cirrhosis |> filter(Bilirubin <= 3)` is equivalent to `filter(cirrhosis, Bilirubin <= 3)`
:::

::: notes
Both pipe operators pass the **object on its left** as the **first argument** to the **function on its right**.

In this workshop, we'll use both kinds of pipe in code examples and quiz questions, so that you get used to seeing them both. 

Those two lines of code are equivalent.

In both cases we're taking the data frame, passing it as the first argument to the `filter()` function, and adding a condition that we're filtering by. 

We could say the same thing of the second line of blue code on your screen which uses the newer pipe.
:::

## Pipes make Output into the next Input! 

```
cirrhosis %>%
  filter(Copper >= 100) %>%
  select(Bilirubin, Platelets, Stage)
```

-   Start with the `cirrhosis` data frame. **THEN**, to that:
-   Filter so that we get only certain rows **THEN**, to that:
-   Select so that we get only certain columns.

::: notes
Here's why the pipe (`%>%` or `|>`) is so useful.

"Tidy" functions like `select()`, `filter()`, and others we'll see later always have as first argument a data frame, and they always return a data frame as well. Data frame in, data frame out.

This makes it possible to create a **pipeline** in which a data frame object is handed from one `dplyr` function to the next. The data frame result of step 1 becomes the data frame starting point for step 2, then the result of step 2 becomes the starting point for step 3, and so on.

You might wonder why we've put each step in its own line. Is this a requirement? No, it's not. Many R users like to use **whitespace** (new lines, tabs, spaces, indents) to make their code more human readable.

By connecting logical steps, you can get a **pipeline** of data analysis steps which are concise and also fairly human readable. You can think of the pipe symbol as the word "then...", describing the steps in order.

This approach to coding is powerful because it makes it much easier for someone who doesn't know R well to read and understand your code as a series of instructions.

I want to ask you... could I change the order of the select and filter steps here?  Why or why not?

OK, I want to see if you grasp this concept, as it's pretty important, moving forward. How would you rewrite the statement on your screen, select mydata comma first name comma last name, and use the pipe syntax instead? Share what you think the answer is.

## Create or Update Columns {.section-break background-image="media/cork-board.png" background-size="400px" background-repeat="repeat"}

::: notes
Let's say you want to add a new column to your data frame, or update a column by changing it in some way (say, convert kilograms to pounds). dplyr has a function for that, too!
:::

## mutate()

Create new or updated, optionally calculated columns.

`mutate(data_frame, [name = value])`



::: notes
`mutate()` is an extremely useful `dplyr` function, and you can use it to make new variables / columns. That's what we'll use it for here. You can also use `mutate()` to change existing columns (say, turn an entire column lowercase or round or scale a numeric value).

Like all `dplyr` functions, `mutate()` takes a data frame as its first argument. After that, you tell it what to name the new column and what should be in it. This is done using **name-value expressions**.

In **name-value expression**, you have:

-   a name
-   an equals sign (`=`), and
-   a value

And you can see that it's put it at the end here.  But let me show you a trick on how to fix that!

## Piping it all together {.smaller}

* Reduce columns to just a few
* Reduce rows ()
* Add new column
* Reorder the columns so it makes better sense

So our first step is to take the cirrhosis data frame and then push that through a pipe to a select function, where we winnow it down to just a few columns.  This "after" is going to become the "before" of our next step!

::: notes
OK, so again our "after" from last step became our "before for this step, and we've used mutate to add a column.  We're getting really close.  But we want our columns to be in a different order!  Let's use "select" again!

::: notes
I'm introducing some tricks here.  I could have just put the columns by name in that last select statement: ID comma N Days comma N Years comma Status comma Drug.  But what if I had fifty columns, not five?  That could be annoying.  I wanted to introduce you to a couple of helper functions.  starts_with (and there's also ends_with and contains) can help you get all of the variables that have a certain naming pattern.  And "everything" in this context gets everything that hasn't already been mentioned by name.

## Group By and Summarize {.smaller}

A very common use case is to divide your data into groups, and get information about each group.

![](media/group_by_summarise_mini.png){.half fig-align="center"}


::: notes
Group by combined with summarize is a way for us to lump cases together and then get a statistic for each group.  For example, maybe you want the median blood sugar for girls and the median blood sugar for boys in your study, or the maximum wait time for King of Prussia emergency department patients and the maximum wait time for University City emergency department patients.

When you use group by, you have to tell R how to separate your cases into groups.  In the image here, there are three groups, each of which is represented by a different shade of gold. Any variable that is categorical data can be used to group.  For example, you can group by sex, or race, or zip code.  Maybe these three groups are three states, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware!

Once you have your data in groups, you can then use the summarize command to get summary statistics for each group.  The summary for each group is represented in blue in this small image.

Summarizing can take lots of different forms!  Sometimes you want to know how big the group is, how many members it has.  Sometimes you want to know what the average value of something is per group, or what the maximum value is.  You can also summarize and give several different measures for each group, like maximum, minimum, mean, and median.  It looks like in this image there are two values given for each group.  Maybe we have two values for New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, like the number of patients we have in each state and the number of patients in each state using Medicaid.
:::

## Group By and Summarize {.smaller}

Note that when you do math on null values (NA) in R, the answer is always NA, so a lot of times in R you have to explicitly say "remove the NA values" in order to get a value.

This code appears in your exercise file, so you can try it there!

```
cirrhosis |>
  group_by(Hepatomegaly) |>
  summarize(Mean_Cholesterol = mean(Cholesterol, na.rm = TRUE), 
            Median_Cholesterol = median(Cholesterol, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Your Turn {.smaller background-color="#e3faf1"}

Open `session_4.qmd` and work through the entire exercise file!


```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

:::
:::

::: notes
To recap, `dplyr` is a package you can load in R that provides a grammar for transforming data frames. Some of the key `dplyr` functions are:

`select()`, which subsets columns by name `filter()`, which subsets rows by a logical condition, and `mutate()`, which creates new calculated columns or changes existing columns

Additionally, `dplyr` and other `tidyverse` packages make use of the pipe operator, which can be used to string together `dplyr` functions into a pipeline that performs several transformations.

Finally, `group_by()` and `summarize()` work together to allow you to calculate per-group summary statistics.

## Cheatsheet (more dplyr functions!)

![](media/dplyr_cheatsheet_snapshot.png){.two-thirds .bordered fig-align="center"}

::: notes
RStudio creates and distributes a number of cheatsheets for various purposes. You can find them by clicking in the **Help menu** in RStudio -- try that now! Here's an image of the `dplyr` cheatsheet. As you can see, there are lots of other functions that dplyr offers.

Other `dplyr` functions include `arrange()`, `distinct()`, `group_by()` (which is especially helpful when combined with `summarize()`), and many more!
